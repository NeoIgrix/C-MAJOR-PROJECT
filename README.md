# C-MAJOR-PROJECT
A command-line tool that implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm in pure C.
It supports encryption and decryption of any file type, handles single and multi-block processing, and uses padding for proper block alignment.
The project includes full DES components such as key scheduling, Feistel rounds, S-boxes, permutations, and built-in test vector validation.
Designed as an academic/learning project to demonstrate cryptography and bitwise operations in C.
